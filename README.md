This project is intended to assist in the automatic generation of FlatBuffer IDL/schemas from Java source.

* FlatBuffers: https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/
* Building schemas with Maven: https://github.com/davidmoten/flatbuffers

## This is a very early proof-of-concept currently being developed in spare time.
